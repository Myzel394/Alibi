# Supporting Alibi

You can support Alibi in various ways:

## Contribute to the project

Add a new feature or fix bugs.

## Add translations

Translate Alibi into your language so that other people can use it more easily.

## Donate

It might sound crazy, but if you would just donate 1$, it would totally mean to world to me, since
it's a really small amount and if everyone did that, I can totally focus on Alibi and my other open
source projects. :)
